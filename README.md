Huge thanks for original author Ville Könönen for open-sourcing this
absolute classic gem from the good old DOS days.

**Note:** Please note that hill records from open sourced version are
not accepted in any of the hiscore lists. You need to play original
closed DOS version to qualify.

## Build

This repository is for SDL2 port. If you would like to build or play
original Skijump International 3 on DOS, take a look at [original
version](https://github.com/suomipelit/skijump3) instead.

### Compiling with Free Pascal

Build has been tested on Windows 10.

You can find instructions how to compile Pascal SDL2 applications from
[Free Pascal meets SDL
site](https://www.freepascal-meets-sdl.net/sdl-tutorials/). You can
either install just Free Pascal Compiler or Lazarus IDE which bundles
editor and the compiler.
