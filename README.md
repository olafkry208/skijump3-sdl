## Playing

[Original Quick
Guide](https://github.com/suomipelit/skijump3-sdl/blob/master/QUICK.TXT)

**Note:** Please note that hill records from open sourced version are
not accepted in any of the hiscore lists. You need to play [original
closed DOS version](https://www.nomasi.com/sj3/download.html) to
qualify.

## Build

This repository is for SDL2 port. If you would like to build or play
Skijump International 3 on DOS, take a look at [open-sourced DOS
version](https://github.com/suomipelit/skijump3) instead.

### Compiling with Free Pascal

Build has been tested on Windows 10 and Linux.

You can find instructions how to compile Pascal SDL2 applications from
["Free Pascal meets
SDL"](https://www.freepascal-meets-sdl.net/sdl-tutorials/). You can
either install just Free Pascal Compiler or Lazarus IDE which bundles
editor and the compiler.

Code needs to be compiled as Turbo Pascal (`-Mtp`).
